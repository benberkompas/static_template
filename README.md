Static Site Template
==============================

This minimal server can be used to serve plain HTML and CSS. It's taken from 
[Heroku's excellent tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/static-sites-ruby).

## How to set up

1. Fork this repository, and name your fork after your project.
2. Clone your fork.
3. `cd project_name`.
4. Run `bundle install`.
5. To start the local server, run `rackup -p 3000`.

If you are running this on your local machine, you can then visit
<http://localhost:3000> in your browser to see your code.

If you are using [Nitrous.io](http://nitrous.io), you can then click "Preview -
Port 3000" to view your site.
